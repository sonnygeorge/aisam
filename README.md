Work-in-progress code.


## Verbiage

- For solving any given problem, think: can "thinking patterns/templates" (transformations) be _recursively_ applied?
- "Learning recursive thinking programs"
- Spurious learning of recursable programs (SLeRP): theory and applications (for memory-contrained inferencing)
